Software Development Life Cycle

Interpreting user needs can sometimes be a challenging task. Often times the needs and wants become blurred and it is the task of the product owner to make that determination. To do this, the product owner will need to determine what value does the feature/functionality have and does it contribute to the overall product. To be able to implement these needs, they are broken down into tasks called User Stories which answer 3 basic questions: Who, What, and Why. By forming these User Stories, it provides a guide to the development team as to the purpose of the code they are creating.

After completing this course, I feel I have a better sense on how to approach a project. Before I would like at a very high level view of a project and then just dive right in and start coding. I now know that having some structure as to how to complete programs/projects will make it easier to not only complete it, but make it more readable, reusable, and maintainable. In the future, I would like to strive to break down the requirements of the project and be able to segment the work into smaller more manageable iterations, while also being open to change throughout the process.

In software development, being a good team member is more than just being able to do your part of the code, it means being a resource for your team members as well. By this I mean, if there a team member that may be struggling in a certain area, offer to help teach (not just do) so as to allow your team member to grow as well. Also, being a good team member mean be accountable for your work as well. If you are struggling, don't wait and wait, speak up and ask for help. Falling behind on your own work can put the project in jeopardy as well.
